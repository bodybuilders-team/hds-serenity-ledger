In several instances of the base implementation, the commit message is observed only as being a response to a prepare
message.
As such, receiving a commit message ahead of other messages is not expected and leads to it being ignored.

Furthermore, an acknowledge is not sent back to the sender of the prepare message, as the commit message is the one
expected to be the "acknowledge" of the prepare message. This goes against the algorithm's specification, which states
that a commit message should be broadcasted to all other processes. In this implementation, the commit message is only
sent to the processes that sent the prepare message.
